# Alex the Analyst Bootcamp
As part of this Data Analyst Bootcamp, I used datasets from Kaggle about video game sales and Starbucks locations. I created visualizations using different graphs and charts that involved understanding the data, using Marks, Filters, Sorting, and I also created a dashboard.

I also used Bins, created Calculated Fields, and created visualizations for Video Game Sales, and I used Joins to look at complete data for my visualization of Employee Salary.
