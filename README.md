# Alex the Analyst Bootcamp
As part of this Data Analyst Bootcamp, I used a dataset from Kaggle about video game sales. I created visualizations that involved understanding the data, using Marks, Filters, Sorting, and I created a dashboard.

I also used Bins, created Calculated Fields, created visualizations, and used Joins. Finally, I did a project in Tableau.
